<h1>Burger Shop Management System 🍔</h1> 
<h2>Technology: Java Swing* 🕹️ + File Handling 📜+ OOP </h2>
<br><br>
<p>I developed this Burger Shop Management System as my second desktop application using Java Swing. The primary goal of the project is to store, update, and manage customer records through text file handling, showcasing my ability to work with Java file I/O operations effectively.</p> 
<br>
<p>This project includes several core functionalities such as adding new customers, updating existing details, deleting records, and viewing customer information all through an intuitive graphical user interface. 
</p>

<h2>🧩 Features 🧩</h2> 
<div><p>
🔎 Add Customer – Save new customer records in txt File <br>
🔎 Update Customer – Modify existing customer details in txt File.<br>
🔎 Delete Customer – Remove customer records in txt File. <br>
🔎 View Customer – Display stored customer information through txt File.<br> 
</p></div>
<p>By building this software, I was able to demonstrate my skills in object oriented programming, GUI design, and file handling without relying on database systems. It reflects my capability to create practical, user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems using Java.
